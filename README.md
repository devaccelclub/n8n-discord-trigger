[n8n](https://www.n8n.io) nodes to trigger workflows from Discord messages.

This node utilizes a Discord bot to transmit or receive data from child processes when a node is executed. Fully updated and tested for 2025, with enhanced stability, cross-platform support, and advanced message handling features including debounce, cooldown, and multi-bot support.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.


## Bot Setup

To send, listen to messages, or fetch the list of channels or roles, you need to set up a bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

1. Create a new application and set it up as a bot.
2. Enable the **Privileged Gateway Intents** for Message Intent.
3. Add the bot to your server with at least **read channel permissions**.



## Operations

With this node, you can:
- Listen to Discord chat messages (both server messages and direct messages).
- React to messages with specific patterns or triggers.
- Fetch lists of channels and roles.
- Use message debounce and cooldown features to control trigger frequency.
- Filter channels by category and manage disabled channels.
- Control channel status (lock, unlock, archive, unarchive).
- Send interactive confirmation messages with custom button labels.
- Track guild member updates and role changes.
- Handle multiple bot instances with multi-credential support.
- **NEW: Voice Channel Support** - Record and process voice conversations.
- **NEW: Voice Activity Detection** - Trigger workflows when users speak.
- **NEW: Audio Recording** - Capture voice data in multiple formats (OGG, PCM, WebM).
- **NEW: Transcription Ready** - Built-in support for speech-to-text services.



## Credentials

You need to authenticate the node with the following credentials:
- **Client ID**: The OAuth2 client ID of the Discord App.
- **Bot Token**: The bot token of the Discord App.
- **n8n API Key**: The API key of your n8n server.
- **Base URL**: The API URL of your n8n instance (e.g., `https://n8n.example.com/api/v1`).

Refer to the [official n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/) for more details.


## Compatibility

- Tested on n8n version 1.75.2
- Fully compatible with 2025 n8n versions
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)


## Usage

To use this node:
1. Install it as a community node in your n8n instance.
2. Configure the required credentials.
3. Set up triggers for Discord messages based on your use case.
